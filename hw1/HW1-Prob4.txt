1. 3 things I learned:
	* "The greatest value of a picture is when it forces us to notice what we never expected to see." - John Tukey
	* Five principles of effective visualizations:
		- Have graphical integrity
		- Keep it simple
		- Use the right display
		- Use color carefully (strategically)
		- Tell a story with data
	* Use visualization to question our initialization and play different visualizations in the data to see the pattern.

2. 2 things that were interesting:
	* As a data scientist, the objective of visualization is not to make data look pretty but to communicate the data. (don't do 3D charts)
	* Effective visualization helps you create a clear idea or mental picture.
